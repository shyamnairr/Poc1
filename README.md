# POC1 - Sales Report with Angular Bar Chart and Table

This is my first POC for the internship project.

##  Tech Stack
- Angular (Standalone)
- Chart.js (for Bar Chart)
- HTML/CSS

##  Features
- Displays a simple sales summary in table format
- Displays corresponding Bar Chart using Chart.js
- Data is currently hardcoded (stub data for demo purpose)

##  Folder Structure
- src/app/report â†’ contains the full component code

##  Notes
- This POC was built purely for UI visualization based on stub data
- Once APIs are available, actual data can be integrated easily

##  Outcome
- Successfully demonstrates Angular component creation, data binding, chart rendering, table display, and styling.
