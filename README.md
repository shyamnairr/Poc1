# POC1 - Sales Report with Angular Bar Chart and Table

This is my first POC for the internship project.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Angular (Standalone)
- Chart.js (for Bar Chart)
- HTML/CSS

## 🔥 Features
- Displays a simple sales summary in table format
- Displays corresponding Bar Chart using Chart.js
- Data is currently hardcoded (stub data for demo purpose)

## 📂 Folder Structure
- src/app/report → contains the full component code

## 🚀 Notes
- This POC was built purely for UI visualization based on stub data
- Once APIs are available, actual data can be integrated easily

## 📊 Outcome
- Successfully demonstrates Angular component creation, data binding, chart rendering, table display, and styling.
